# audiogetter

**This is a work in progress, currently it doesn't compile or run**

The purpose of this application is to allow the search and download of various audio sources such as youtube, vimeo etc. Furthermore 
it's mobile optimized, which means it will only download the audio bytes from a youtube video, resulting in faster downloads and lower mobile data consumption.
